    <h1>Choosing a Pet</h1>
    <p>This page will help you choose between a dog, turtle, or a bird.</p>
    <h2>Dogs</h2>
    <p>Dogs are the most work, but they are also the most fun.  You have to walk them every day, but they love you and will always play with you.</p>
    <h2>Turtles</h2>
    <!--On line 17, there was a period in front of the <p> tag. 
    There was no closing angle bracket as well, therefore, the code was not showing up.-->
    <p>Turtles can also be fun, but they don't play with you.  They will not make a mess of your room and they are quiet.</p>
    <h2>Birds</h2>
    <p>Birds kind of play with you, but they are a lot of trouble and might fly away or start flying all around your room and make a mess of it.</p>

<!--For students, it shows the pets task as 1.1, but on the teacher's side, it shows the life cycle of a frog to be the task for 1.1-->
